## Niffler: A DICOM Framework for Machine Learning Pipelines against Real-Time Radiology Images

Niffler is a research project for DICOM networking. 

It provides an efficient and quick approach to receiving DICOM images in real-time and on-demand from multiple PACS. It extracts DICOM metadata and stores them in a Mongo database. Additional workflows can be run on the images and metadata. One specific example, identifying scanner utilization has been implemented as part of the Niffler Application Layer.
