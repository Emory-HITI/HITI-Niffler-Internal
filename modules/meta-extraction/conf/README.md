# Metadata Extraction Configuration Files

The extraction-profiles consists of several featureset.txt files. Each featureset has multiple attributes. Each featureset corresponds to a collection in the database.

If you desire more DICOM attributes to an existing collection, add the attribute to an existing featureset.txt. Similarly, you may remove existing attributes from the featureset files. 

If you prefer them in a separate collection, create a new txt file with the preferred attributes.

Place the configuration files in the FEATURES_FOLDER identified by the MetadataExtractor.py
