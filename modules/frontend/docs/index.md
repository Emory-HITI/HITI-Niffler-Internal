## Introduction

This particular module deals with the frontend of Niffler. It has two modules:

1. On - Deamand Extraction
2. PNG - Extraction

This module makes use of Flask and web-sockets to run asynchronous tasks.
It has it's very own authentication system.

## Modules

### 1. Basics

We have a **_server.py_** file which handles all the main logic of the Niffler-Frontend and also this is the file we will run to access the frontend.

To run the Niffler frontend module make sure you have all the python modules installed in your project environment. You can do this by following steps:

-   Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler.git
```

-   Now navigate to frontend module, open terminal and type this command to install all the required modules.
    **Make sure you are using virtual environment for development purpose**

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

and all the required packages would be installed.

### 2. Running the frontend module

After install the required modules, make sure you are in the frontend module and open terminal in this module and make sure you are in your developer environment and type

```
$ python3 server.py
```

This will make the server run on port **5000**.

There is also **ADMIN** mode for frontend module. To run frontend in **ADMIN** mode, follow above step but type

```
$ python3 server.py --admin
```

and the server will be switched to **ADMIN MODE.**

-   **Niffler Admin Mode:** Only admin has the ability to signup other users

-   **Niffler User Mode:** Normal users can LOGIN and use Niffler
    ![NIFFLER USER MODE](/modules/frontend/static/images/Niffler_normal.png)

### 3. Project Structure

In this particular module we have the following files/folders:

-   **_server.py:_** This is the main file of Niffler-Frontend module. It has all the logic and working of the module.

-   **_init.py:_** This file has all the basic importing of function such as importing database, sockets so it can be used in other files.

-   **_models.py:_** Models have a user model which is defined for _db.sqlite3_ (This is our database).

-   **_db.sqlite3:_** We are using sqlite3 database as it is light-weight and this only stores users login credentials. So, for now, we are just storing users in this database.

-   **_templates:_** This folder stores all the HTML templates which are used in this module. We have one _base.html_ templatewhich we are extending for all other templates.

-   **_static:_** This folder contains the CSS and images used in the website.

## FUTURE SCOPE OF DEVELOPMENT

---

To add more modules to the Niffler Frontend module we have to do the following steps:

For example lets say we have a module name "ViewImages"

1. Add a frontend HTML template to the templates folder located in frontend modules,
   Ex. Filename **_View_Images_Frontend.html_**
   â†’ Niffler/modules/frontend/templates/ViewImagesFrontend.html

2. In the same HTML file add websockets events to send, process and retrieve data from frontend to the backend.

3. After the processesed data is sent to the backend (server.py), if you wish to perform even more processing you are free to do so.

4. After processing call the respective module,
   for example: Here, "ViewImages" module is called and the processed data list/dictionary is passed to that particular module.

5. After the data is passed, use websocket to emit a loading event to notify user that the data is correct and the module is running. If an error is encountered you can send that error to the frontend by doing the same as discussed above.

6. Once the module has done with it's execution, notify the user and add that to the logs, so the user can check it later.

And there we go, that's the process to add another module with the frontend.
