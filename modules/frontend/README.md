# A Frontend Framework for Niffler

Here we have created a frontend module for Niffler for ease of acccess of it's modules.

This module is using **Flask** as an engine to run all the frontend.
*Make sure you have installed Flask from requirements.txt file.*

Run server.py file by navigating into frontend directory and running:
`python server.py` or `python3 server.py`

Then navigate to `localhost:9000` to view your Niffler modules.

*Currently PNG extraction Frontend is developed and it can take values from frontend and can be passed into backend*
